# Enable Permissions-Policy and Feature-Policy for geolocation when running under Apache
# Requires mod_headers enabled on the server. If your host disables .htaccess or mod_headers,
# you must add the equivalent header in the server config (or hosting control panel).
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(self)"
    Header always set Feature-Policy "geolocation 'self'"
</IfModule>

# If you don't have control of server headers, you can also set in PHP before output (already present in workers.php):
# header('Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(self)');
# Note: Chrome will still block geolocation if the document is embedded in a cross-origin <iframe>
# unless the parent uses the allow attribute (see notes below).
